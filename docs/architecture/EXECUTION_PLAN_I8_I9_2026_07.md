# Execution Plan — I8 / I9 (post–I7, research-aligned)

Parent: [`TARGET_HYBRID_ARCHITECTURE_TZ_2026.md`](TARGET_HYBRID_ARCHITECTURE_TZ_2026.md) · Research: [`RESEARCH_ALIGNMENT_AEC_AI_2025_2026_07.md`](RESEARCH_ALIGNMENT_AEC_AI_2025_2026_07.md) · Prior: I0–I7

## Objective

Translate 2025–2026 AEC AI practice (Blueprint region pipelines, hybrid ACC/RASE, IfcLLM GraphRAG) into **advisory** AeroBIM seams without flipping honesty gates or claiming GO.

## Priority order

| Order | Wave | Why |
|-------|------|-----|
| 0 | **RT-001/002/003** | Customer corpus / norms / MEP — blocks any GO discussion |
| 1 | **I8a** | Blueprint-style regions before whole-sheet VLM |
| 2 | **I8b** | RASE-ish provenance for ACC transparency |
| 3 | **I8c** | HITL escalate unmatched drawing regions |
| 4 | **I9** | IfcLLM-style knowledge graph query (advisory only) |

## I8a — Region detector behind MultimodalDrawingPipeline

- [x] Port/adapter: layout region detector feeding `DrawingRegionRef` (`DrawingRegionDetector` + `HeuristicLayoutRegionDetector`)
- [x] Region-restricted path: detector priors merge with OCR; full-page VLM still degrade
- [x] Honesty: `cv_human_level` stays **MISSING** (pipeline `degraded=True` + reason)
- [x] Tests: detector without raster → `detector_only`; DI token registered
- [ ] Future: YOLO/Blueprint weights behind same port (optional; still MISSING until corpus)

**Driver:** Blueprint (arXiv:2602.13345)

## I8b — RASE-style provenance on advisory findings

- [ ] Optional R/A/S/E tags on advisory issues / norm assist drafts
- [ ] Deep-link `norm_clause` + pack version already present where possible — extend systematically
- [ ] Never write `summary.passed` from RASE/LLM path

**Driver:** Hybrid ACC / LLM→IDS literature (re-verify before public cite)

## I8c — HITL escalate unmatched regions

- [ ] Unmatched / low-confidence `DrawingRegionRef` → `ReviewEvent` / triage queue
- [ ] Frontend consumes `drawing_regions` (types already extended Pass-3)

**Driver:** Cross-document VLM escalate pattern

## I9 — IfcKnowledgeGraphPort (advisory)

- [ ] Domain port + DI token + stub/real adapter unit (Atomic Delivery)
- [ ] Agent allowlist tool: NL → graph/relational query → element GUIDs
- [ ] DeterminismGate mandatory; no capability OK for “IFC LLM understanding”
- [ ] `KNOWN_BUGS` if `@sota-stub`

**Driver:** IfcLLM (arXiv:2605.13236)

## Explicit non-goals

- Claiming GO, >90%, MEP delivered, CDE-ready BCF, customer SLA
- Raising publishable κ gate to 0.80 without customer protocol (stretch SOP only)
- Whole-sheet GPT-4V as product CV
- Raw IFC dumped into LLM context

## Verification (when implementing)

```bash
cd backend
python -m pytest tests/test_architecture_seams.py tests/test_determinism_gate.py -q
# plus wave-specific tests
```
